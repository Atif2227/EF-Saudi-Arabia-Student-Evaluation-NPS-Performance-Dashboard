## 🧠 What’s Different from the Previous Excel Dashboard

Previously, all data extraction, cleaning, transformation, calculations, and visualizations were handled manually in **Excel** using formulas, pivot tables, and static charts.

With the implementation of **Power Query and Power BI**:

- Data preparation is fully automated and standardized  
- Complex calculations such as **NPS, Promoter %, Detractor %, and week-on-week comparisons** are handled efficiently using **DAX**  
- The dashboard is **interactive, scalable, and easy to refresh**  
- Filters and slicers enable instant analysis without modifying formulas  
- Visual indicators like **arrows and colors** provide faster and clearer insights  

Overall, the Power BI solution is **more robust, visually effective, and easier to maintain** than the earlier Excel-based dashboard.
